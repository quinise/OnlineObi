# Online Obi

Forgot your pennies or kola nuts? Online Obi casts IFA Obi divination on your phone! Each cast includes an Odu and it's interpretation, a yes/no/maybe result, and a set of four kola nuts. Casts can be saved (Core Data) for later recollection in this Swift application.

## Project Goals

I set out on on this coding endeavor to learn how to use ReactJS, Vite, Figma, OAuth, and TailwindCSS.

## Run the Code

1. First, clone the repository and cd into the directory.
2. Next, run the following commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:5173

## Recommended VS Code extensions

- `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense` (`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`) — provides autocomplete, linting, and class inspections for Tailwind projects. The workspace recommends this extension in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
- Workspace CSS setting: this project adds a workspace setting to suppress "Unknown at rule" diagnostics for PostCSS/Tailwind directives (`.vscode/settings.json`). Install the Tailwind extension for full IntelliSense and then you can remove or keep the setting as desired.
